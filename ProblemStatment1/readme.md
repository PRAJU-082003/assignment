In this FreeRTOS-based system, two tasks communicate using a queue to perform event-driven operations. **ExampleTask1** periodically (every 500 ms) sends structured data containing `dataID` and `DataValue` to the queue. **ExampleTask2** continuously waits for incoming data from the queue and processes it based on predefined conditions. Depending on the received values, it can modify its own priority (increase or decrease) or even delete itself, demonstrating dynamic task management. This setup illustrates fundamental **RTOS concepts** such as task scheduling, inter-task communication via queues, precise timing using `vTaskDelayUntil()`, and runtime priority controlâ€”all essential for building reliable and responsive embedded real-time systems.
