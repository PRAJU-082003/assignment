1.	Input Power and Charging Circuitry: Connects the 5V input, the battery, and the required passives to the NPM1100's charger section.
2.	Buck Regulator Circuitry: Implements the 3.0V output using the integrated buck regulator.
3.	Host MCU Interface and Status LEDs: Exposes the necessary I/O pins and provides visual status indicators.
4.	Battery Voltage Measurement Circuitry (Bonus): Adds the required components for the host MCU to sample the battery voltage
